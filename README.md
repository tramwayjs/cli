Tramway Core Config is a development utility to facilitate rapid development by generating common boilerplate and generating modules that leverage Tramway architecture with ES2015+. It includes:

1. Command for creating routes and controllers

# Installation

1. ```npm install --save-dev tramway-core-config```
2. You should see a `tramway.js` file appear at the root of your project. If not, add one with the following content: 
```module.exports = require('tramway-core-config');```

# Documentation

* Usage
* Create API
* Create Route
* Create Controller
* Create Service 
* Create Entity
* Create Provider
* Create Connection
* Create Repository
* Create Dependency
* Configuration

## Usage

Replace the COMMAND with the appropriate one from the table below with its corresponding arguments and options.

```
node tramway COMMAND
```

All commands that create new classes will update the corresponding index.js entries.

## Create API
Will create all the necessary classes and mappings to have a full API ready. The routes follow REST and are automatically mapped to their controller action with services instantiated and linked in the Dependency Injection configuration.

| Argument | Command Type | Type | Default | Required | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resource | argument | string | none | yes | The name of the Resource to use for all naming |
| provider | option | string | none | no | Adds a provider key to the Repository declaration to link them |

Example:

```
node tramway create:api Product
```

This command will create the following new files and update corresponding index.js files, as well as configuration files:

entities
-- Product.js
controllers
-- ProductController.js
services
-- ProductService.js
repositories
-- ProductRepositories.js

## Configuration

The commands create their files in the default scalpel that TramwayJS follows

src
-- config
-- controllers
-- services
-- entities
-- repositories
-- providers
-- commands

In some projects, however, the structure can vary and the framework is able to adapt to adjustments using environment variables.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | The root path of the project | ./src |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_CONTROLLERS_PATH | Path to controllers appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | controllers |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_ENTITIES_PATH | Path to entities appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | entities |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_SERVICES_PATH | Path to services appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | services |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_CONNECTIONS_PATH | Path to connections appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | connections |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_REPOSITORIES_PATH | Path to repositories appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | repositories |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PROVIDERS_PATH | Path to providers appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | providers |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH | Path to config appended to TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH | config |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_ROUTES_FILE | Name of the routes file storied in the config directory | routes |
| TRAMWAY_PROJECT_SERVICES_FILE | Name of the services file storied in the config directory | services |

Example: 

```
TRAMWAY_PROJECT_PATH=./dev node tramway create:service Service
```
This command will create a new Service.js file in ./dev/services. It has the same behavior as overriding the dir using the dir option but is meant for a global application.
