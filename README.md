Tramway Core Config is a development utility to facilitate rapid development by generating common boilerplate and generating modules that leverage Tramway architecture with ES2015+. It includes:

1. Command for creating routes and controllers

# Installation

1.  ```npm install --save-dev tramway-core-config```
2. You should notice a tramway.js file appear at the root of your project. If not, add one with the following content: 
```module.exports = require('tramway-core-config');```

# Documentation

## Usage

Replace the COMMAND with the appropriate one from the table below with its corresponding arguments and options.

```
node tramway COMMAND
```

All commands that create new classes will update the corresponding index.js entries.
